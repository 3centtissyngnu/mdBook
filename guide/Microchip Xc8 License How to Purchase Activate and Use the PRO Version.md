Microchip Xc8 can operate in two modes: Free and PRO. The Free mode is available without a license and provides basic code optimization and support. The PRO mode is a licensed mode that requires a purchase of a key for activation. The PRO mode offers advanced optimizations and other features, such as functional safety and code coverage.
 
You can purchase a PRO license for Microchip Xc8 in two ways: perpetual or subscription. A perpetual license is a one-time purchase that gives you unlimited use of the compiler for a specific version. A subscription license is a monthly payment that gives you access to the latest version of the compiler and updates. You can cancel or renew your subscription at any time through your microchipDIRECT account.
 
To activate your PRO license, you need to install the compiler on your workstation and register it with the MPLAB X IDE. You can also change the operating mode of the compiler from the project properties on a build-by-build basis. To check the status of your license, you can use the command line tool xclm or the MPLAB X menu Tools->Licenses->License Status.

Whether you opt for a perpetual or subscription license, you can benefit from the powerful features and optimizations of Microchip Xc8.
  
## Some Features of Microchip Xc8
 
Microchip Xc8 offers a number of features that make it a versatile and powerful compiler for 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers. Some of these features are:
 
- Common Code Interface (CCI): This is a set of APIs that allow you to access device-specific features and peripherals in a consistent and portable way. You can use CCI functions to configure and control timers, ADCs, PWMs, UARTs, SPIs, I2Cs, and more.
- Data Memory Management: This feature allows you to optimize the use of data memory by allocating variables in different memory regions, such as RAM, EEPROM, or program memory. You can also use qualifiers to specify the memory access mode, such as read-only or volatile.
- Code Optimization: This feature allows you to improve the performance and efficiency of your code by applying various optimization techniques, such as dead code elimination, constant folding, loop unrolling, function inlining, and more. You can also use pragmas and attributes to control the optimization level and behavior for specific functions or variables.
- Code Generation: This feature allows you to generate code for different target devices and architectures, such as PIC10/12/16/18 or AVR. You can also use directives and macros to customize the code generation for specific devices or features.
