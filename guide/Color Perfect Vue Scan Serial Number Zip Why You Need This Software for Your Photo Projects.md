It lets you choose the input source (Flatbed, Transparency), the media size (A4, Letter), the bit depth (8-bit, 16-bit), the resolution (dpi), and the color mode (Color, Grayscale, Black & White). It also has a Crop button that lets you crop your scan area.
 
The Professional mode gives you even more control over your scan settings. It lets you adjust the exposure (Brightness, Contrast), the color balance (Red, Green, Blue), the color correction (Color Balance, Color Space), and the image enhancement (Sharpening, Grain Reduction). It also has a Lock Image Color button that lets you lock the color settings for multiple scans.
 
The Advanced mode gives you full control over your scan settings. It lets you access all the options available in VueScan, including advanced features such as multi-exposure scanning, infrared cleaning, batch scanning, raw file output, and more.
