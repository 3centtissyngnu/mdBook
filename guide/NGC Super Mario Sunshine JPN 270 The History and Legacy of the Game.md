# The Doors Live In Europe 1968: A Rare Glimpse of the Legendary Band
 
The Doors were one of the most influential and controversial rock bands of the 1960s, led by the charismatic and enigmatic Jim Morrison. Their music combined elements of blues, rock, psychedelia, poetry and theater, creating a unique and powerful sound that captivated audiences around the world.
 
One of their most memorable tours was in 1968, when they performed in various European cities, including London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Stockholm. The tour was filmed by a crew from Granada TV, who captured the band's live performances as well as interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The result was a documentary titled *The Doors: Live In Europe 1968*, which was released on VHS in 1988 and later on DVD in 2004.

The documentary captures the spirit of the 1960s, a decade marked by political turmoil, social change, artistic experimentation and youth rebellion. The Doors were part of this movement, as they challenged the status quo with their provocative lyrics, controversial performances and anti-establishment attitude.
 
The documentary also shows the contrast between the band's popularity in Europe and their troubles in America.
