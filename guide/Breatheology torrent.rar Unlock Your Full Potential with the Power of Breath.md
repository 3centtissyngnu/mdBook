## Cube-IQ: A Powerful Load Planning Software (continued)
 
In this article, we will explore some of the features and benefits of Cube-IQ that make it the ultimate load planning software for logistics professionals.
 
### High-Speed Optimal Load Plans
 
Cube-IQ can generate optimal load plans for any type of container, pallet, crate or box in seconds. It can handle multiple containers of different sizes and shapes, as well as multiple destinations and priorities. Cube-IQ can also optimize the loading of rolls, cylinders, drums and other irregular items. Cube-IQ uses a proprietary algorithm that is fully developed in-house and constantly improved by ongoing research and development. Cube-IQ can achieve the best possible volume and weight utilization, as well as minimize the number of containers needed for a load.
 
### Graphical User Interface
 
Cube-IQ has a complete graphical user interface that allows you to easily create and edit loading jobs with point-and-click and drag-and-drop actions. You can view the load plans in 3D, rotate them, zoom in and out, and change the colors and labels. You can also drag and drop items to modify the load plan manually, and Cube-IQ will update the load plan accordingly. Cube-IQ can also generate loading diagrams, reports and labels that you can print or export in various formats.
 
### Built-In Database Engine
 
Cube-IQ has a built-in database engine that stores all your data securely and efficiently. You can import and export data in CSV, Excel or XML formats, and share the database across multiple users with ODBC compliance. You can also customize the database fields and tables to suit your specific needs. Cube-IQ can also integrate with your existing ERP, WMS or TMS systems for full automation and data exchange.
 
### Flexible Loading and Stacking Rules
 
Cube-IQ offers full flexibility in loading and stacking rules, which you can define for each orientation of a box. You can specify the maximum weight, height, length and width of each item, as well as the minimum and maximum number of items per layer or per container. You can also set rules for overhangs, gaps, orientation restrictions, stability factors, center of gravity, axle weight limits and more. Cube-IQ can also work in multiple units that can be switched on the fly or even mixed.
 
These are just some of the features and benefits of Cube-IQ that make it a powerful load planning software. If you want to learn more about Cube-IQ or request a demo, please visit the official website[^1^] or contact MagicLogic Optimization Inc.
