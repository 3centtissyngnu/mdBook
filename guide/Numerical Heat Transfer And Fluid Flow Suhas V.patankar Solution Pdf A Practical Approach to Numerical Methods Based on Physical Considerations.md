Heat transfer and fluid flow are two important phenomena that occur in many engineering applications, such as power generation, cooling systems, chemical reactors, and biological systems. To design and optimize these systems, engineers need to understand the underlying physical processes and predict their behavior under various conditions. Numerical methods are powerful tools that can help engineers solve complex problems involving heat transfer and fluid flow.
 
One of the most influential books on numerical methods for heat transfer and fluid flow is *Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow* by Suhas Patankar, published in 1980 by Taylor & Francis[^2^]. This book focuses on the finite volume method, a widely used technique for discretizing partial differential equations that govern heat transfer and fluid flow. The book covers the basic concepts of discretization methods, heat conduction, convection and diffusion, calculation of the flow field, and some special topics such as turbulence modeling, multiphase flow, and radiative heat transfer. The book also provides illustrative applications of the numerical methods to various problems in engineering and science.

The book is written in a clear and concise manner, using simple algebra and elementary calculus to develop the numerical methods. The author explains the physical aspects of heat transfer and fluid flow, as well as the mathematical formulation and solution techniques. The book also includes numerous examples and exercises to help readers practice and test their understanding of the numerical methods. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners who want to learn more about numerical methods for heat transfer and fluid flow.
 
A pdf version of the book can be found online at [^2^]. However, readers are advised to purchase the original book from the publisher or other sources to support the author's work. Alternatively, readers can also refer to another book by the same author titled *Numerical Heat Transfer*, published in 1984 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation. This book is a revised and expanded version of *Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow*, with more topics and examples on heat transfer.
 
In conclusion, *Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow* by Suhas Patankar is a classic and comprehensive book on numerical methods for heat transfer and fluid flow. It provides a solid foundation for engineers and scientists who want to solve complex problems involving heat transfer and fluid flow using numerical methods.
  
One of the main advantages of the finite volume method is that it can handle complex geometries and irregular grids. The method is based on the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in each control volume, which is a small region of the computational domain. The method also ensures that the numerical solution satisfies the boundary conditions at the interfaces between the control volumes. The finite volume method can be applied to both steady-state and transient problems, as well as to both laminar and turbulent flows.
 
The book presents several numerical schemes for discretizing the governing equations, such as the central difference scheme, the upwind scheme, the hybrid scheme, and the power-law scheme. The book also discusses the methods for solving the resulting algebraic equations, such as the Gauss-Seidel method, the successive over-relaxation method, and the alternating direction implicit method. The book explains how to choose the appropriate numerical scheme and solution method for different types of problems and how to assess the accuracy and stability of the numerical solution.
 
The book also covers some advanced topics in heat transfer and fluid flow, such as natural convection, forced convection, heat exchangers, boiling and condensation, multiphase flow, radiative heat transfer, and turbulence modeling. The book provides detailed derivations and explanations of the physical models and numerical methods for these topics. The book also includes several case studies and applications of these topics to real-world problems, such as solar collectors, nuclear reactors, heat pipes, jet impingement cooling, and combustion.
