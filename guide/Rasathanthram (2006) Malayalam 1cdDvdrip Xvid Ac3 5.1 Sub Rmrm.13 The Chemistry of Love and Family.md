The movie also deals with the social issues of child trafficking, domestic violence, and caste discrimination. Kanmani is a victim of all these evils. She was sold by her mother to a rich landlord who treated her as a slave and abused her physically and sexually. She belongs to a lower caste and faces discrimination from the upper caste people. She has no identity or dignity of her own. She finds solace and happiness in Premachandran's company, who treats her with respect and kindness. She also learns to read and write with his help.
 
Rasathanthram is a movie that has a lot of humor and emotions. The comedy scenes involving Innocent, Jagathy Sreekumar, Mammukoya, and Suraj Venjaramoodu are hilarious and entertaining. The emotional scenes involving Mohanlal, Meera Jasmine, Bharath Gopi, and K.P.A.C. Lalitha are touching and realistic. The movie also has some beautiful songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja and sung by K.J. Yesudas, K.S. Chithra, Sujatha Mohan, Madhu Balakrishnan, and others. The songs are well-picturized and suit the mood of the movie.
