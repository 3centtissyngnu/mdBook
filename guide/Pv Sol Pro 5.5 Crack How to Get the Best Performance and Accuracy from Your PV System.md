## What is PV\*SOL Pro 5.5?
 
PV\*SOL Pro 5.5 is a dynamic simulation program that allows you to model and calculate the performance of photovoltaic systems in various scenarios. You can design and visualize all types of systems, from small rooftop installations to large-scale solar parks, using the extensive product database that includes over 21,900 PV modules, 5,500 inverters, 2,600 battery systems and many other components[^1^]. You can also import your own products or create custom ones.
 
PV\*SOL Pro 5.5 uses a unique 3D visualization feature that enables you to create realistic representations of your systems and their surroundings. You can import 3D models from Google SketchUp or other CAD programs, or use the built-in 3D objects library. You can then perform a detailed shading analysis based on the 3D objects and the sun's position throughout the year[^2^]. This will help you determine the optimal orientation and tilt of your modules, as well as avoid potential shading losses.

## What are the benefits of using PV\*SOL Pro 5.5?
 
By using PV\*SOL Pro 5.5, you can enjoy many benefits that will make your solar projects more efficient and profitable. Some of these benefits are:
 
- Accurate predictions: PV\*SOL Pro 5.5 uses sophisticated simulation models that take into account various factors such as irradiance, temperature, module characteristics, wiring losses, inverter efficiency, battery behavior and more. You can also simulate different load profiles, tariff structures, feed-in incentives and self-consumption scenarios[^2^]. This will allow you to make better design decisions and provide reliable estimates of your system's output and income.
- Detailed proposals: PV\*SOL Pro 5.5 allows you to generate high-quality project reports that can be customized and edited according to your needs. You can include technical data, graphs, tables, photos, circuit diagrams and more[^2^]. You can also export your reports to PDF, Word or Excel formats. These reports will help you present your proposals to your clients and partners in a professional and appealing way.
- Financial forecasting: PV\*SOL Pro 5.5 enables you to perform a comprehensive economic analysis of your system over 20 years. You can input your system costs, financing options, depreciation rates and maintenance expenses[^2^]. You can also use the current feed-in tariffs from our database or enter your own values[^1^]. PV\*SOL Pro 5.5 will then calculate your cash flow, net present value, internal rate of return and payback period[^2^]. This will help you evaluate the profitability and feasibility of your system.
