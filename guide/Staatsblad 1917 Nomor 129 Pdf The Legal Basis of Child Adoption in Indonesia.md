## What is Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129?
 
Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129 is a law that was issued by the Dutch colonial government in Indonesia on December 29, 1917. It is also known as the Law on Adoption or the Law on Adoptive Children. It was intended to regulate the legal status and consequences of adopting a child in Indonesia, especially for non-Muslims who followed the civil law system.
 
The law consists of 15 articles that cover various aspects of adoption, such as the conditions, procedures, effects, and revocation of adoption. Some of the main provisions of Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129 are:
 
- Adoption can only be done by a married couple or a widower who has no children or whose children have died.
- Adoption can only be done for a male child who is under 19 years old.
- Adoption requires the consent of the adoptive parents, the biological parents or guardians of the child, and the child himself if he is above 12 years old.
- Adoption must be done by a notarial deed and registered at the civil registry office.
- Adoption gives the adopted child the same rights and obligations as a biological child of the adoptive parents, such as inheritance, maintenance, education, and surname.
- Adoption severs the legal relationship between the adopted child and his biological parents, except for certain matters such as marriage prohibition, criminal law, court fees, evidence, and testimony.
- Adoption cannot be revoked by the parties themselves, but can be annulled by the court if it violates any of the conditions or procedures of adoption.

## How Does Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129 Affect Adoption in Indonesia?
 
Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129 was one of the first laws that regulated adoption in Indonesia. It was based on the Dutch civil law system and aimed to provide legal certainty and protection for adoptive parents and adopted children. It also reflected the social and cultural norms of that time, such as patriarchy, primogeniture, and lineage preservation.

However, Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129 also had some limitations and problems that made it unsuitable for the current situation in Indonesia. Some of these are:

- The law only applies to non-Muslims who follow the civil law system. Muslims who follow the Islamic law system have their own rules and regulations on adoption that are different from Staatsblad 1917 Nomor 129.
- The law only allows adoption for male children who are under 19 years old. This excludes female children and older children who may also need adoption.
- The law requires a notarial deed and registration for adoption. This creates administrative and financial barriers for many people who want to adopt a child.
- The law severs the legal relationship between the adopted child and his biological parents. This may cause psychological and emotional problems for both parties, especially if they want to maintain contact or reconnect in the future.
- The law does not address some of the modern issues related to adoption, such as intercountry adoption, foster care, child trafficking, child abuse, child rights, and child welfare.
