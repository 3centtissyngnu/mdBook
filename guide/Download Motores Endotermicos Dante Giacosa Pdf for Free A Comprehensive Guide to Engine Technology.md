The author of Motores Endotermicos, Dante Giacosa, was born in Rome in 1905 and graduated in mechanical engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin in 1927. He joined Fiat as a junior engineer and worked his way up to become the head of the design department in 1946. He was responsible for some of the most successful and influential Fiat models, such as the Topolino, the 500, the 600, the 850, the 124, the 127, and the 128. He also designed several sports and racing cars, such as the 8V, the Dino, and the Abarth. He retired from Fiat in 1970 and became a consultant and a writer. He published several books on automotive engineering and history, including his autobiography Forty Years of Design with Fiat.
 
Motores Endotermicos is not only a technical manual, but also a reflection of Giacosa's passion and vision for engine design. He believed that engines should be efficient, reliable, simple, and adaptable to different needs and conditions. He also emphasized the importance of experimentation, testing, and feedback in the development process. He wrote with clarity and precision, but also with enthusiasm and humor. He shared his insights and experiences from his long and distinguished career, as well as his admiration for other engineers and inventors who contributed to the advancement of engine technology. He also discussed the social and environmental implications of engine use and development, such as pollution, noise, safety, and fuel consumption.
 
Motores Endotermicos is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about internal combustion engines and their applications. It is also a testament to Giacosa's genius and legacy as one of the most influential and respected automobile designers and engineers of all time.
