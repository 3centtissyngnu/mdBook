The software offers three types of scans: quick scan, deep scan and custom scan. The quick scan checks the most common locations for malware infections, such as memory, registry and startup items. The deep scan performs a thorough analysis of your entire system, including all files and folders. The custom scan allows you to choose which drives, folders or files you want to scan. You can also exclude certain files or folders from scanning based on their extensions or attributes.
 
The firewall feature of Sunbelt VIPRE Antivirus Premium 4.0.3904 monitors your network activity and blocks any unauthorized or suspicious connections. You can choose between three firewall modes: simple mode, learning mode and advanced mode. The simple mode automatically allows or denies connections based on predefined rules.
