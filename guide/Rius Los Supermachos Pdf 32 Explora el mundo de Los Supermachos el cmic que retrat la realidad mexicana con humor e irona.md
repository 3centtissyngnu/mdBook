Rius Los Supermachos Pdf 32 is a digital collection of 32 issues of the comic book series Los Supermachos, created by Eduardo del RÃ­o, better known as Rius. Rius was a Mexican cartoonist, writer and political activist who died in 2017. He was famous for his humorous and critical comics that tackled social, political and religious issues in Mexico and beyond.
  
Los Supermachos was one of his most popular and influential works. It debuted in 1965 and ran until 1973, when Rius left the series due to censorship problems with his publisher. The comic book featured the inhabitants of San Garabato, a fictional rural village in Mexico, who often discussed and debated current affairs, history, ideology and culture. The main characters included Calzonzin, an indigenous peasant who was naive but curious; Chon Prieto, a cynical and radical teacher; Perpetua, a conservative and devout Catholic woman; Don Cacahuate, a wealthy landowner and politician; and many others.

Rius used humor, irony and sarcasm to expose the corruption, oppression, ignorance and hypocrisy that plagued the country. He also educated his readers about alternative perspectives, such as Marxism, socialism, anarchism, feminism, ecology and atheism.

In this article, we will review some of the most memorable and relevant issues of Los Supermachos, and how they reflect the historical and social context of Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s. We will also analyze the artistic style and techniques of Rius, and how he used them to convey his message and engage his audience.
  
## Los Supermachos: A Mirror of Mexico
  
One of the main strengths of Los Supermachos was its ability to capture the reality and diversity of Mexico, both in its content and in its form. Rius did not shy away from portraying the problems and challenges that faced the Mexican people, such as poverty, inequality, violence, repression, censorship, racism, sexism, imperialism and religious fanaticism. He also showed the richness and complexity of the Mexican culture, such as its language, folklore, traditions, humor, music and art.
  
Some examples of issues that dealt with these topics are:
  
- Los Supermachos No. 1: "El pueblo que no querÃ­a votar" ("The village that did not want to vote"). This issue introduces the main characters and the setting of San Garabato, where the villagers are reluctant to participate in the rigged elections organized by the PRI. Rius exposes the fraud and manipulation that characterized the Mexican electoral system, and the apathy and resignation of the citizens.
- Los Supermachos No. 6: "La guerra de los pasteles" ("The pastry war"). This issue revisits a historical episode from 1838, when France invaded Mexico over a dispute about some damaged pastries. Rius uses this absurd pretext to mock the imperialist ambitions of France and other foreign powers, as well as the weakness and corruption of the Mexican government.
- Los Supermachos No. 13: "La Virgen de Guadalupe" ("The Virgin of Guadalupe"). This issue explores one of the most important symbols of the Mexican identity and religion: the image of the Virgin Mary that allegedly appeared to an indigenous man in 1531. Rius questions the authenticity and significance of this miracle, and criticizes the role of the Catholic Church in oppressing and exploiting the native population.
- Los Supermachos No. 32: "El Chahuistle" ("The Corn Blight"). This issue deals with one of the most serious crises that affected Mexico in 1970: a fungal disease that destroyed a large part of the corn crops, which are essential for the Mexican diet and economy. Rius blames the government for its negligence and incompetence in handling the situation, and denounces the social and environmental consequences of the agricultural policies.

These are just some examples of how Rius used Los Supermachos to reflect and comment on the Mexican reality, using humor and irony as tools for education and awareness. He also used different formats and genres to adapt to his audience and his message, such as comic strips, comic books, magazines, newspapers, posters, flyers and books.
