# Vocal Imitation v1.0.1: A Software That Lets You Mimic Any Voice
 
Vocal Imitation v1.0.1 is a software that claims to let you imitate any voice by processing vocal files. It was released in 2008 by Trifinpistru, a developer who also uploaded some samples of the software on SoundCloud[^1^]. But is this software really worth trying? Here are some pros and cons of Vocal Imitation v1.0.1 based on a review by CNET[^3^].
 
## Pros
 
- The software is easy to install and use. You just need to load a vocal file, adjust some parameters, and save the output.
- The software has a variety of effects and filters that you can apply to the vocal file, such as pitch, speed, formant, echo, reverb, and distortion.
- The software can produce some interesting and funny results, especially if you use it with different voices and languages.

## Cons

- The software is not very accurate or realistic. It often sounds robotic, distorted, or unnatural.
- The software is not compatible with Windows Vista or later versions. It only works with Windows XP or earlier versions.
- The software is not free. It costs $129.95 for a full version, which is quite expensive for a software that does not deliver high-quality results.

## Conclusion
 
Vocal Imitation v1.0.1 is a software that lets you imitate any voice by processing vocal files. However, it has many drawbacks that outweigh its benefits. It is not very realistic, not compatible with newer versions of Windows, and not cheap. Therefore, it is not recommended for anyone who wants to create professional or convincing voice imitations. There are other voice cloning apps that are more advanced and reliable, such as Voice.ai[^2^], which is free to use and works with any PC application.
